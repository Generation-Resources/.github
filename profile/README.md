# Generation Resources GitHub Org

This is where ***Generation Instructional Staff*** can find the *Master versions* of *Class Repositories*, Final Projects, and other assignments, as well as other helpful resources.

- All class repositories and other activities or projects that students will be interacting with should be hosted on the [GenUSA Learners](https://github.com/GenUSA-Learners) GitHub Org
  - Site docs for Gen Learners contains directions and information on:
    - Class repo how to:
      - clone it to their computer
      - create a 'working' branch
      - pull new changes
      - commands they shouldn't run on the main branch
      - fixing/resetting the class repo
      - navigating the repo file structure
      - completing homework listed in the Homework folders
    - Other:
      - 2 git cheatsheets
      - Personal Access Tokens
      - Installing the `code .` shortcut

- Repositories hosted here are for Staff use only
- Master Repos hosted here are available as *Template Repositories* that can be easily copied and modified as you see fit for your own cohort
  - To use a Master Repository as a template, navigate to the repository you want to use and click on the green `Use this template` button, then select `Create a new repository`. You can  transfer ownership of the repository to the Gen-USA-Learners account so your learners can find it easily and have access to the site documentation

- Activities and solves you may want to use or add to your class repo are located in Activity Bank repositories.
  - JWD Staff:
    - Clone the jwd activity bank repo so you can easily copy folders and files over to the class repository you're building

- If you don't have access to something you need, please message your Master Instructor
